            <h3>My Work</h3>
            <p>I have already worked on a range of projects during my time in school. These projects have allowed me to further develop my skills and apply what I have learned in a real-world setting.</p>
            <h3>They tell it better than I ever could</h3>
            <p>"We were thrilled to have selected [Insert name] to redesign the software icons for our new brand. Their proffessionalism, skill, and attention to detail stood out among the candidates we considered."</p>
            <p>"I had the pleasure of working with [Insert Name] on a recent project, and I couldn't be more impressed with their work. Not only did they bring my vision to life, but they also added their own creative touches that took the project to the next level.</p>
